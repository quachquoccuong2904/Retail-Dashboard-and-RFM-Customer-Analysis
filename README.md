## Business Context  

The retail company, operating in the **bicycle industry**, is undergoing rapid growth and facing increasing competition in the market. To remain competitive and enable **data-driven decision-making**, the company needs a **centralized analytics solution** to continuously monitor its business performance across multiple dimensions.  

Specifically, the management team requires a **Retail Dashboard** that provides real-time insights into three critical perspectives:  

### 1. Growth  
Measure the **business growth rate** within the period **01/01/2020 – 30/06/2022**, enabling management to evaluate overall store performance and make strategic decisions based on actual growth trends.  

### 2. Products  
Track the **value contribution of products** through four key measures:  
- **Revenue** – Total sales generated by each product  
- **Profit** – Net gains after deducting costs  
- **Orders** – Number of product transactions over time  
- **Return** – Returned items to monitor product performance and customer satisfaction  

### 3. Customer  
Monitor **customer growth** over time and evaluate the value contributed by customers across various demographic and geographic segments:  
- **Region** – Geographical areas where customers are located  
- **Age Group** – Demographic segmentation for understanding customer profiles  
- **Education Level** – Correlation between educational background and purchasing behavior  
- **Income Level** – Insights into customers' purchasing power and value contribution  

Analyze customer performance based on **Revenue**, **Profit**, and **Orders** to identify **high-value** and **high-growth** customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns and retention strategies.  

## Data Collection  

The dataset is sourced from the **AdventureWorks** sample database and includes:  
- Customer information  
- Product details  
- Regional and time dimensions  
- Sales and return transactions
You can find and download the source data at the following link: [Retail Dashboard Data](https://github.com/quachquoccuong2904/Retail-Dashboard-and-RFM-Customer-Analysis/tree/main/Retail_Dashboard_DATA)

## Data Modeling  

I designed a **Snowflake Schema** to structure the data for analysis.  
The model includes:  

- **6 Dimension tables (Dims):**  
  - DimCustomer  
  - DimProduct  
  - DimDate  
  - DimRegion  
  - DimEducationLevel  
  - DimIncomeLevel  

- **2 Fact tables (Facts):**  
  - FactSales: Stores all sales transaction data  
  - FactReturns: Stores all product return information

## Data Analysis & Visualization  

After performing data transformation in **Power Query**, creating **DAX measures** and **calculated columns**, as well as defining new **KPIs** for business monitoring, we developed 4 key dashboards to deliver actionable insights:  

1. **Company Growth:** Visualizes the company's growth trend during the period **01/01/2020 – 30/06/2022**.  

2. **Product Performance:** Measures product contributions across **Revenue**, **Profit**, **Orders**, and **Returns**.  

3. **Customer Insights:** Tracks customer purchasing behavior across multiple dimensions such as **Income Level**, **Education Level**, **Territory**, and **Generation**.

## Key Insight Summary
- **Growth**:  
  - Revenue growth showed significant fluctuations, especially during the period 30/06/2021–30/06/2022, with an increase of 15.6M, equivalent to +176.55% compared to the same period last year.  
  - **GMP** remained stable at 38–42%, which is considered ideal compared to the bike retail industry average of only 25–30%.  
  - The **Standard** customer segment accounted for 92.9% of total customers.  
  - Revenue distribution by region: **North America (38.97%)**, **Europe (31.27%)**, and **Pacific (29.77%)**.  

- **Product**:  
  - **Bikes** dominated in terms of revenue and profit.  
  - **Accessories** recorded the highest order volumes but also had the highest return rates.  
  - Pareto analysis revealed that **93% of total profit** came from three sub-categories: **Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes, and Touring Bikes**.  

- **Customer**:  
  - The number of customers surged significantly between Feb 2021–Jun 2022, increasing by over 300% compared to previous months.  
  - **Generation X** and **Baby Boomers** were the two largest customer groups.  
  - Most customers belonged to **low–to–medium income levels** and had an **Undergraduate (not yet graduated)** education background.  

## RFM Customer Analysis

The analysis indicates a **dramatic increase in the number of customers**, suggesting that the store has achieved **strong brand recognition** in the bike retail industry.  

However, an in-depth review of two KPIs, **Revenue per Customer (RPC)** and **Profit per Customer (PPC)**, shows a significant decline in the value contribution per customer, with figures dropping to **1.43K USD** for RPC and **600.47 USD** for PPC, representing decreases of **33.71%** and **32.44%** compared to the same period last year.  

This raises a concern: Although the customer base has grown, **average spending per customer has decreased significantly**.  

To address this, an **RFM Customer Analysis** was conducted to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, with the goal of solving two key challenges:  
1. **Increasing sustainable revenue per customer**  
2. **Establishing long-term customer relationships**
